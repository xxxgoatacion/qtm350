    "   - Different regions developed their own encoding systems (e.g., ISO 8859-1 for Western Europe, Shift-JIS for Japanese), leading to **incompatibility issues**.\n",

    "   - **How It Occurs:**\n",
    "     - The CPU operates at a much faster speed than the memory, but it must wait for data and instructions to be fetched from memory before execution can proceed.\n",
    "   - **Effects on Computer Performance:**\n",
    "     - Slows down overall system performance due to the disparity between CPU speed and memory bandwidth.\n",
